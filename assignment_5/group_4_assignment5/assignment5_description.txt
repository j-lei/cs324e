Our animation is science-themed. We wanted to create a 'vaporwave'
aesthetic reminiscent of shows like Bill Nye the Science Guy.

CLASSES
Sphere - Junsung Lee
  The Sphere class creates a mesh-only sphere that takes in x, y, z
  coordinates and a radius and spin direction as properties through
  its constructor. It then makes a rotating sphere that slowly changes
  color in accordance to its current angle. 

  The Sphere also has the option to display red and white electrons
  that circle around it on its x, y, and z axes.

HeliumAtom - Zachary Martinez
  The HeliumAtom class creates a model of a Helium atom with 2 neutrons,
  2 electrons, and 2 protons. It takes a property for radius through
  its constructor, and makes the model with the electrons orbiting the
  atomic nucleus.

Baymax - Jennifer Lei
  The Baymax class creates a model of Baymax from Big Hero 6, with a 
  stack of robotic cubes orbiting it. It takes in parameters for scale,
  position, angle, and color through its constructor. It then loads in
  the obj and texture.
  
  Baymax spins in one direction, while the cubes orbit him and rotate 
  as well. The cubes change color according to his current angle, with
  each stack containing 2 cubes with opposing colors.

DIFFICULTIES
Our team's biggest difficulty was properly using textures with objs.
We had initially tried a different obj set with a different texture,
but that one failed to load correctly at all. The current obj texture
does load, but we weren't able to figure out how to get the eyes to
only show up once on the figure. 

We tried all different combinations of textureMode() and textureWrap(), and also tried resizing/changing the texture file, but nothing worked, so now Baymax has like eyes everywhere, which is actually kind of
disturbing.
